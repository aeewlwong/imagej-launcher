The ImageJ launcher is a native application for launching ImageJ.

It supports the following flavors of ImageJ:

* [ImageJ1](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA)
* [ImageJ2](https://github.com/imagej/imagej)
* [Fiji](https://github.com/fiji/fiji)

## Purpose

The launcher provides a platform-specific entry point into the ImageJ Java
application. Its most major function is to facilitate the ImageJ Updater
feature by taking care of pending updates when ImageJ is first launched.

## Usage

For an overview of supported options, run:

    ./ImageJ-xyz --help

where `xyz` is your platform.

## Download

Up-to-date versions can always be downloaded from the
[Jenkins](http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher/) platform-specific
configurations.
